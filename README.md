Textbook
--------
[Stewart, *Calculus Early Transcendentals*, 6th ed.](http://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=xEro7OMQWE4&offerid=239662.9780495011668&type=2&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.barnesandnoble.com%2FCalculus%2FJames-Stewart%2Fe%2F9780495011668)

**Important Note:** you do not need to buy the textbook using the link above.
This link is only provided for your reference.  

Any version of the textbook---e.g., hardcover, paperback, eBook---is fine, but
*you will need access to the [WebAssign][] online homework system* in order to
complete your homework assignments. You can purchase access directly through the
[WebAssign website][], but it may be more economical to buy a hard copy of the
book that comes bundled with a WebAssign access code. Such bundles are available
in the university bookstore. 

*You must have access to WebAssign for this course.*  To reiterate, you can
purchase it separately from the [WebAssign website][], or as part of a textbook
bundle at the university bookstore.  Note that, since WebAssign access provides
you with a (somewhat restricted) electronic version of the textbook, it is not
absolutely necessary to purchase a hard copy of the book.  However, it is highly
recommended that you have a hard copy, or at least an electronic version that you
can view on a tablet when studying in the library.  If you limit yourself to only 
the electronic access that is provided through WebAssign, you may not find it very 
convenient and, as a result, you might end up studying from the textbook less 
often than if you had purchased a hard copy.

Exams
-----
**Mid-term Exams**: There will be two mid-term exams each worth 25% of the final
course grade. The exams will be scheduled as we progress and you will be given
at least one week notice of the exam date.  Do not make and travel arrangements
which would cause you to miss a lecture, or you might end up missing one of
these exams and there are no make-up exams.  

**Final Exam: Friday, May 2, 4:00--6:30 in LeConte 113**   
In accordance with university policy, the final exam must be taken by all
students at the scheduled time. *There are no make-up exams.*

Homework
--------
Solving lots of problems is the best way to prepare yourself to do well on the
tests and quizzes, and ultimately do well in the course.
Online homework will be assigned approximately once per week and will typically
be due on Friday evenings. 
Late homework will not be accepted or graded. Your 10 best homework assignments
will be counted toward your grade.

All homework for this course will be done with [WebAssign][].
You will enroll yourself in our course by going to the 
[WebAssign website][] and using the following class key:

**WebAssign Class Key:** sc 3475 0829


Make-up Policy
--------------
*There will be no make-up homework or exams.*
If you must miss an exam for a legitimate reason, contact the professor
at least three days prior to the exam date and you might be allowed
to take the exam *before* the scheduled exam time. 

If you miss a test due to unforseen circumstances, you must contact the 
professor within one class meeting after the missed test and provide an 
explanation. If your excuse is accepted, the missed test score may be replaced 
with 80% of your final exam score. For example, if your excuse is accepted and 
you score a 90% on the final, then you will receive a 72% for the missed test 
(0.80*0.90 = 0.72).


Grading Policy
--------------
Each mid-term exam is worth 25 points, the final exam is worth 35 points, and
homework is worth 15 points,  The following scores will guarantee the
following grades. The scale may be shifted at the end of the semester,
depending on overall student performance.  All curving (if any) will occur 
at the end of the semester.  

+ A: 92--100  
+ B+: 87--91   
+ B: 82--86   
+ C+: 77--81  
+ C: 72--76   
+ D+: 67--71   
+ D: 60--66   
+ F:  0--59    


Attendance
----------
Students are expected to attend all classes, recitations, and computer labs.
A grade penalty will be exacted if you have an excessive number of absences
(whether excused or unexcused); see the [Bulletin of Undergraduate Studies][].
Specifically, you are permitted (but strongly discouraged from taking) seven
absences in total between lecture, lab, and recitation. Each absence in addition
to that will result in the deduction of 5 points from your final grade. Roll will be
taken at the beginning of every class; if you are late, that counts as an absence.
If you plan to leave before class is over, the correct procedure is to mention this
to the professor before the start of class. It is impolite and disruptive to
your classmates if you leave, or noisily pack up your belongings, before the
lecture is over. 

Use of Electronics During Lecture
---------------------------------
Silence and refrain from using all electronic devices (phones, ipods, tablets,
microwave ovens, etc.) during class and exam periods.  The only exception to
this policy is the use of computers or tablets for the purpose of referring to
an electronic copy of the textbook, or the online (WebAssign) homework
problems. Using a computer during lecture to check your Facebook account, for
example, will not be tolerated.  Besides preventing you from learning, it is
disturbing to other students. 


Academic Honesty
----------------
Cheating will not be tolerated. Violations of this policy will be referred to
and dealt with by the USC Office of Academic Integrity, in a  manner consistent
with university regulations, which range from a warning to expulsion from the
university. 


Supplemental Instruction and Tutoring
-------------------------------------
Supplemental Instruction consists of review sessions run by undergraduate
students who took this course previously and aced it. 

[The Math Tutoring Center](http://www.math.sc.edu/mathlab.html)
runs walk-in help desks around campus. No appointment necessary.
